          <h3>Hi ðŸ‘‹</h3>
          <p>I&apos;m Mariusz. Welcome on my website ðŸ˜‰</p>
          <p>
            I have been interested in programming since I was a child. In the beginning, I created a code on pieces of
            paper because I did not have a computer. Later, when I got Atari at the age of 11, I was able to finally try
            out my ideas for software and games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many years have passed since then and programming is still my passion. I like to challenge myself, learn
            about modern technologies and solve problems. Various projects appeared in my career - I created mobile
            applications, CRM systems, comprehensive platforms from scratch. I dealt with both frontend and backend, I
            got to know many different environments and frameworks. Currently, however, I&apos;m focusing on frontend
            and React.
          </p>
          <p>
            Privately, I&apos;m a fan of cycling, camping and generally being outdoors. In the past, I was involved in
            film editing and designing and programming light and music shows.
          </p>
          <p>
